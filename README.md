# How to run the app:

It is very simple to execute what we have so far. You don't even need to clone the whole repository. 

Just copy and paste the content of the API.py file and paste it to a python file from a project that you have already created, or run it using the terminal. 

After running it, you will get something like this on the console:

To make sure the API is working, upload any picture or take a picture, and you should see the text "hardcoded result" on the result screen. You should also see this on Chrome console:
